MCC (Mirth Configuration Creator)
Programmed By: Caleb Meyers
Current Version: 2.2.4
Last Update: 6/24/25
=================================

Version 2.1.0:
-First full beta release of MCC application

Version 2.2.0:
-Added backup functionality via the packaged MCC-SIDEKICK.jar application

Version 2.2.1:
-Added forced disconnects after Mirth Database queries/changes to avoid Mirth service hanging.
-Added the full list of users to "CHECK UN" button and update Mirth password queries.
-Changed "RESET UN/PW" and update password command to update only the selected Mirth username.
-Fixed bad channel generation where channel scripts/descriptions contain "bad" characters that got translated when building XML. Character found: "…".

Version 2.2.2:
-Added "[MORE FUNCTIONS]" button to the GUI. "MORE FUNCTIONS" contains "REPAIR CORRUPT DB" and "DATABASE OVERVIEW"
-"REPAIR CORRUPT DB" rebuilds the "log" folder in the database, then copies the files into the new folder
-"DATABASE OVERVIEW" generates a report including Mirth version, database size, channels, and users
-Fixed bug where Mirth service state checks were happening after changing the target Mirth database directory (causing issues in instances where Mirth DB files exist, but service was never installed)

Version 2.2.3:
-Restructured code to not export and rely on files from the database. Reads the data directly and stores necessary parts in ArrayLists
-Fixed open database connection that would be left over when using the "DATABASE OVERVIEW" (from the checkUN call)
-Fixed bug that would generate an "invalid" channelTags XML tag in the full configuration export if no channelTags were present in Mirth
-Added feature where MCC will now automatically generate the "SFTP Restart Channel" if an SFTP connection type is detected. This generation is toggleable via "MORE FUNCTIONS" 
-Added command to fully wipe and delete the full, code template, and channel folders between exports. Avoids issues if initial backup from 1 database is ran, then databases are switched, and a second backup is ran
-Fixed bug and added additional check when generating the SFTP Restart Channel. Bug was not checking if the SFTP Restart Channel id was in the current arraylist. If so, then do not generate the channel
-Fixed popups from MCC to snap to the application, rather than the center of the screen

Version 2.2.4:
-Added feature where MCC will remember the last theme, and will load it on subsequent launches
-Fixed channel generation for Mirth channels and full configurations for Mirth versions <3.5. Changes include not adding "exportData" tags to the channel generation
-Added option under "MORE FUNCTIONS" to toggle the old (pre Mirth 3.5) channel generation and new (Mirth version >3.5) channel generation
-Fixed the DATABASE OVERVIEW report generation on Mirth versions <3.5 to properly display channels and their status
-Fixed REPAIR CORRUPT DB logic to not copy all items from the archived log folder. Instead it targets "new" database files, allowing Mirth to rebuild them on the next db start/query
