2/8/2025 - First full export successfully tested. Exports full channel information, exports channelMetadata, and creates a full channel export in ".xml" format
2/11/2025 - Added first rough GUI. Contains an "Export Channels" button to trigger the channelExport. Includes log text area that updates post export completion
